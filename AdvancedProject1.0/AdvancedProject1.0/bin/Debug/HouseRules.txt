Once you have signed a lease with us, please follow these simple rules to ensure the safety, comfort, wellbeing and enjoyment of everyone in the house. 
Failure to abide by these rules will result in a warning and/or subsequent immediate termination of your lease agreement. 

No Smoking
Keep noise (TV / Stereo) to a moderate level at ALL times – especially between the hours of 9pm and 7am.
Please be quiet when entering and exiting the house late at night. 
Please clean (vacuum and dust) your room at least once a month.
Everyone is responsible for keeping the common areas clean and tidy (i.e. bathroom/toilet/laundry/kitchen/lounge/outside areas.) Do not leave empty bottles, food or rubbish around - put junk mail / newspapers in the bin. Outdoors is not the cleaners responsibility!
Dishes/Pots/Pans, etc. should be washed, dried and put away immediately after cooking and eating. The cleaner will not do your dishes!
Make sure all electrical items e.g. TV, Fans, Lights, Heaters, etc. are turned off when not in use.
REMINDER: Electricity is not included with your rent so try to use it as economically / efficiently as possible. All housemates are required to pay for electricity usage, regardless what time period they are actually occupying the premises.
Housemates are required to submit all requests and questions through the SR 24/7 system, and will receive an induction on how to use SR24/7.
Any damage to the house and/or to Student Rooms’ furnishings will be paid for by the responsible housemate. If damage is done to a shared/common item (e.g. kitchen bench or lounge suite) the cost will be shared equally among all housemate’s bonds.
All personal items and belongings must be kept in your bedroom. It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your personal items and belongings. Student Rooms are not liable for any loss or damage to personal items and belongings.
Bikes must be kept outside in garage area/undercover area only – do not store your bike inside the house.
No pets or animals allowed on the property (inside or outside) at any time.
When your contract comes to an end your room must be left in exactly the same state as when you originally moved in to it. A minimum $75 contents / damage check & cleaning fee is payable by ALL tenants for whom room cleans are required. For a substantially untidy room the cleaning fee will increase depending on the time required to clean.

The following are completely unacceptable and will lead to immediate notice to leave:
NO smoking, naked flames or burning candles (including Incense) inside.
No fan heaters, however electric-oil heaters are permitted (and provided by Student Rooms, 1 heater per room).
NO illegal drug use, illegal activities or excessive drinking of alcohol.
NO weapons or violence

Enjoy Yourself! :)
